- `assets/`: Directory containing images and other assets

## Development

To make changes to the site:

1. Edit the HTML, CSS, or JavaScript files
2. Commit and push changes to the repository
3. GitHub will automatically update the site

## Local Testing

To test the site locally, you can use any simple web server. For example:

```bash

## Required Image Assets

The site requires the following image assets in the `assets/` directory:

1. `assets/logo.png` - The oioi logo
2. `assets/demo.gif` - Demonstration of the app in action
